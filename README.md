US Airports and Air Traffic Controllers
This project displays a centered map of the United States along with all the airports that are within. Any plane symbol is a representation of an airport. The green colored planes represent airports with air traffic controllers and the black planes represent airports without air traffic controllers. The states are color coded according to how many airports are within state boundaries. States with 0 airports are represented by a white color and as the number of airports increases within a stateâ€™s boundaries the color fo the state gets progressively redder in color. There is a legend in the top right corner to help the user understand what the different colors represent. The libraries used include chroma.js, font awesome, leaflet.css, and.leaflet.js. The data source for the airports came from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-small-scale-dataset-airports-of-the-united-states-201207-shapefile, while the data for the US-state boundaries came from Mike Bostock of D3.
